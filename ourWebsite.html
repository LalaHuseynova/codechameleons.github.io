            <p class="text"> Our team's third homework assignment focuses on grasping the nuances of website development. To get ready for this task, each team member individually finished extensive courses on HTML, CSS, and Java on <strong class="sitename">Code Academy</strong>. Demonstrating proficiency in these individual aspects, we smoothly moved on to the hands-on phase of our project, applying the knowledge acquired from the courses to collaboratively construct our website. The CodeAcademy courses acted as a sturdy base, enabling us to effortlessly combine our skills and progress toward the triumphant realization of our shared vision for the site. </p>
