        <h1>Hour of Code</h1>
        <p4>On October 25th, our team organized a successful Hour of Code event at secondary school No. 251. Despite the school's limited expertise in informatics, 23 enthusiastic 9th-grade students participated. We introduced ourselves, showcased ADA University, and engaged students in interactive coding exercises. The students, initially unfamiliar with such learning methods, expressed great satisfaction and interest in pursuing computer-related fields. Our team's preparation, including prior research and a pre-event meeting, ensured a smooth delivery. Here are some photos that were taken during this mesmerizing event.
